Then I prototyped the kernels for CUDA and made sure my python ""kernels"" produced correct output which combined to create a full decoder. Then I built my CUDA implementation with the python version as a reference for verification.

This usually involves reading a lot of documentation from different Python packages and creating extra test cells where I would enter some information and print out the output or try to see what sort of data I'm working with, until I iteratively arrive at a working solution.

I also used created Jupyter notebooks for a data science curriculum to be taught to students from under-sourced communities in India. This process started with formulating worksheets that these notebooks would complement, then finding appropriate data to illustrate basic data science concepts.
