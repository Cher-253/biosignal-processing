Timestamp,Participant ID,How would you rate your overall coding session?,"Rate the statement: During the coding session, I programmed like I would normally program.",Rate the statement: The wristband affected my ability to code. ,We set up your workstation like this. Can you describe how your workstation is similar/different?,"Is there anything that you do differently that you couldn't do within this setup? e.g. A specific place you program, a specific time, a specific group of people? Would you work longer/shorter?"
8/28/2018 14:06:22,111,4,4,5,Trackpad. Pretty similar. ,Closed room without people; work at night. Headphones/earplugs. Self-conscience. Wristband made me more aware of my emotions and my stress response. Monitor is straight. Earplugs. 
8/28/2018 15:20:55,112,6,5,1,"If I'm doing homework I'll often sit on the couch or in bed and program. If its for work its usually at a desk. I also use a laptop, often without a mouse, which definitely at least slightly decreases my performance",I usually binge program since as soon as you walk away from personal code it becomes nonsense. Additionally I often watch TV on a second screen or listen to music as I find it kind of weird to code in silence.
8/28/2018 17:12:09,113,3,6,1,"I always program on a laptop using the laptop screen (i.e. no Desktop or attached monitor), and I feel that that allows me to more easily hunch over the project and get up close and personal with the questions, especially in a confined space such as the International House Library, where I usually do my programming assignments. I prefer programming in libraries, surrounded by other people, because it encourages me to stay on task. This contrasts with my preference to do reading and writing assignments in the comfort of my own room, away from others.","I tend to work with noise-canceling headphones and lyric-less music (e.g. classical, jazz), but I chose not to do that since this was my first time programming in months and I wanted to stay completely focused on the task at hand. The music can help me focus, but only when I'm already familiar with the gist of the problem set or project and am in some sort of groove of productivity. When I'm reading about a project for the first time or combing through instructions, I prefer to do so in silence so my attention is undivided.

I prefer working on programming assignments alone, only going to others when I have already attempted a solution and am completely stumped and unable to make progress.

I take my time when working on assignments and projects, and I take frequent breaks, perhaps even between every 2-3 problems completed. I would work longer.

I prefer to program in the evening; it can feel rewarding to make significant progress before bed, and it's depressing for me to be engrossed in my little 13"" laptop screen during the day when the sun is shining."
8/29/2018 10:02:15,211,5,5,6,I almost entirely work on a laptop so this keyboard/mouse took a bit of adjusting to. Usually work at a desk,"no specific places, times, or people. usually listen to music and work for longer chunks of time"
8/29/2018 14:11:26,212,7,4,1,"i have vim keybindings in jupyter notebook, and i use funcy so i don't have to futz around with mutable state. i also have a MS ergonomic keyboard, and this keyboard was surprisingly uncomfy for my wrists","eh,  i listen to music, otherwise i program pretty much wherever and whenever, in any state of wakefulness or sobriety....................the biggest difference for me is the keyboard stuff, vim keybindings and mac/windows differences. "
8/29/2018 16:13:24,214,6,6,4,"My desktop has two monitors, although I primarily use one monitor for programming and one for background tasks like messaging and music playback. I have a mechanical keyboard.","I normally listen to music while I program. The genre varies with my mood but I tend to default to uptempo jazz. The amount of time varies with the length of the task. Anything from 20 minutes to 6 hours, or more with breaks."
8/31/2018 11:56:13,411,6,6,2,"I normally use my laptop, which is a Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon (2017) and has a 13"" screen. I usually use the trackpad instead of a mouse.","One difference is that during the session I found that I was looking for the Home key on the keyboard because I often do ctrl+shift+home to highlight an entire line of code, but the lack of this key did not really affect my coding. I would probably work for a bit longer, in efforts to solve the 3rd problem that I didn't get to finish. The time in the corner from the screen recorder might have affected me a bit because I wanted to get to all four problems within the given time, so I think I rushed a bit."
8/31/2018 12:49:52,412,2,5,1,"I normally work on a laptop, not with a monitor. Also, I sometimes like to lay down in bed and work with my laptop in my lap.",I think this was pretty representative of what I normally do.
8/31/2018 14:25:58,413,4,3,4,"In my workstation, I usually have 2 monitors and a dark theme for all my programming environments. It was similar by using Jupyter Notebook. ","I typically program later at night, and work on longer pieces of code. I also program with water and snacks near me. In addition, I program with music playing in the background. "
8/31/2018 16:11:15,414,3,3,4,"My workstation is with a Windows laptop and wireless mouse. Usually I would work on my desk or using sometimes a school computer. Some similarities were the use of a swivel chair and desk, and the main differences were the large screen monitor, wire mouse with mousepad, and the separated keyboard.",Generally I listen to music when I am coding and I may be coding around other people that are performing similar tasks. I have done classes involving coding for over an hour and I generally would have worked longer. Sometimes I code at night with lights off and I may also be eating or snacking when I am coding.
9/4/2018 17:45:02,512,7,6,2,"My workstation is very similar to this, with minimal items on the desk, and probably a notebook or some scratch paper off to the side. The only thing ""missing"" was my water bottle, which I would usually drink from as a quick break a few times while coding.","I think the physical setup of this desk, computer, etc did not change much about the code I would write or the way in which I approached the problems. When working through homework problems and assignments I prefer to work alone, so this was ideal. I like to talk with friends / go to office hours if there are particularly challenging questions that I would like to discuss or get help on. Copy+pasting was a little slow with this keyboard just because my finger's are trained to find ""cmd"" where ""alt"" is, but that's about it!"
9/5/2018 14:39:22,613,5,7,1,Very similar. Font-size might be slightly larger in my workstation.,I would work a bit longer to add comments and test cases to my code.
9/5/2018 15:58:03,614,6,6,2,"I typically work on my laptop, so my mouse is a touchpad. Even when I hook my laptop up to an external monitor, I have an external trackpad that sits below my keyboard. I work a lot on the train, so I rarely use a workstation.","I would work longer and get the function to work right. Mainly by handling all the corner cases, and my doing some more testing. Otherwise, this setup is fine."
9/6/2018 14:18:05,711,6,7,1,"Usually I sit on a sofa at home and code on my laptop, so I'm more used to a more comfortable chair and smaller screen, but I wouldn't say I was uncomfortable or unfamiliar with the environment set up during the experiment, since it resembles the workstation I had during my summer internship at an actual company.","I usually have water next to me so I can take water breaks. A good amount of the time, I code at home by myself on my sofa so I'm also used to more comfort. I usually code for longer periods of time so it wasn't hard for me to focus during this experiment, since I didn't really need water/bathroom breaks."
9/6/2018 17:19:01,713,7,6,2,"Similarities: I usually use a single monitor and full-screen window when I program.

Differences: I generally use Linux instead of Windows, and I have an elaborate set of window manager hotkeys that allows me to quickly tab back and forth between editors/browsers/terminals/etc. I also generally program on a laptop with a trackpad instead of using a mouse. (I have used workstations almost exactly like this one for internships and stuff, though.)","No, the setup didn't prevent me from doing anything I would've done normally. (Except that, y'know, I usually work on large projects instead of interview-style questions.)"
9/7/2018 16:13:45,813,3,6,1,"I code on a mac machine so the keyboard is different. It took me some time to adjust to it. I wasn't sure how the ctrl + paste work on this keyboard, and that costed some time  for me to figure out.  ","I like working at night. That's usually when my head is the clearest and my performance is the best. For this experiment, I planned my time on each question based on 40 minutes, but the fact that I only got around 20 minutes could be the reason I didn't work out all questions. I usually assign a block of time to code so I am not under time constraint. "
9/7/2018 17:20:43,811,4,6,2,"I usually use a laptop. So this workstation (screen and keyboard) is much bigger than I'm used to, but not totally foreign since it resembles the workstations in the labs in my undergrad university where I have had several coding sessions. ","I usually prefer programming alone, and sitting at a desk. So this wasn't too different. I would work longer since I feel I would've been able to solve the 4 questions if I had more time. "
